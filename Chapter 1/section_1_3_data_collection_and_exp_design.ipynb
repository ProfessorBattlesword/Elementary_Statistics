    "    * **Blinding** is a technique where the subject does not know whether he or she is receiving a treatment or a placebo.\n",
    "    * A **double-blind** experiment is a technique where neighter the subject nor the experimenter knows if the subject is receiving a treatment or a placebo."

    "    <img src=\"Cluster_sample.jpg\">\n",
    "* **Systematic sample:** choose a starting value at random. Then choose every $k^{\\text{th}}$ member of the population.\n",

    "    In the West Ridge County example you could assign a different number to each household, randomly choose a starting number, then select every $100^{\\text{th}}$ household.\n",
    "    <img src=\"Systematic_sample.jpg\">\n",
    "* **Convenience sample:** choose only members of the population that are easy to get\n",
    "    * This often leads to biased studies and is *not recommended*.\n",
    "    * Just because a sample is convenient and easy to get does not mean the sample represents the population well.\n",
